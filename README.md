# HandTracking-Mediapipe
MediaPipe is an open-source, cross-platform library for building multimodal (e.g. video, audio, sensor) applied ML pipelines. The Hand Tracking MediaPipe project is a demonstration of how MediaPipe can be used to track the movement of hands in real-time video. It uses a machine learning model to infer the location and orientation of the hands in each frame of the video, and then renders a 3D representation of the hand on top of the video. The pipeline is optimized for performance on mobile devices and can run in real-time on smartphones or tablets. It is a good example for developers looking to build similar hand tracking applications, or to learn how to use MediaPipe for other multimodal ML projects.
